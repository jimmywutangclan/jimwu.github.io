        <p class="Intro">I am a student in Computer Science and Game Development at Northeastern University, and I kind of got here because
            this major was the perfect synergy of two things I've always loved, electronics and games.
        </p>
        <p>
            This all started back in 2007, when I was in first grade and some teenagers introduced me to the Nintendo DS. Right off the bat, I went haywire over how exciting
            it all looked, and it hooked me into the world of gaming. From gaming, I then got hooked onto the PC through Roblox, and long story short, I'm who I am now.
        </p>

            Nowadays, I'm just a compsci student, having recently concluded a co-op at Mythics Inc. as a DevOps engineer. I'm going back to school this semester, ready to learn about computer graphics, computer networks, and game engine development.
