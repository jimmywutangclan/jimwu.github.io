        <p class="Text">I am a second year Computer Science and Game Development at Northeastern University, and I kind of got here because
            this major was the perfect synergy of two things I've always loved, electronics and games.
            I've been obsessed with the concept of creating games my whole life, and back in middle school you would have found me on Roblox every day,
            either as a commander in my clan or making levels for fun.</br>
